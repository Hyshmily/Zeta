# Zeta Domain Glossary

## Core Concepts

- **Hot Key** — A cache key accessed with abnormally high frequency. Ambiguous term; use **Local-Hot** (algorithm-detected) or **Worker-Hot** (`KeyState.HOT`, Worker-broadcasted) when precision matters.
- **Local-Hot** — A key whose frequency exceeds the HeavyKeeper TopK threshold on the local App instance. Triggers local L1 promotion but may differ from the cluster-wide view.
- **Worker-Hot** — A key broadcast by the Worker as HOT (`KeyState.HOT`) via AMQP. Carries a `decisionVersion` for ordering. Grants the longest L1 TTLs (1h default).
- **Worker-Cool** — A key broadcast by the Worker as COOL (`KeyState.COOL`). Signals the key is cooling down after a HOT period. Preserves original normal TTLs.

## Cache States

- **KeyState** — Enum: `NORMAL` / `HOT` / `COOL`. HOT and COOL are set by the Worker; NORMAL is the default. Transitions: `NORMAL ↔ HOT` (via Worker broadcast), `HOT ↔ COOL` (via Worker broadcast), `COOL → NORMAL` (via expiry + reload).
- **NORMAL** — Default state. No Worker involvement. Local TopK can freely promote to HOT.
- **HOT** — Worker-broadcasted hot decision OR local promotion result. Longest TTLs (hotHardTtl / hotSoftTtl). Never degraded or overwritten by local decisions.
- **COOL** — Worker-broadcasted cool decision. Preserved when the Worker cluster is healthy (majority quorum satisfied). Eligible for local promotion to HOT only when majority quorum fails (graceful degradation mode).

## Components

- **App** — The user's Spring Boot application that pulls `zeta` as a dependency. Runs local L1 (Caffeine), optional L2 (Redis), local TopK, and the Reporter-to-Worker AMQP link.
- **CacheCompressor** — Pluggable interface for L1 cache value compression. `Lz4CacheCompressor` (default when `lz4-java` is on classpath) compresses `String` and `byte[]` values above 256 bytes using LZ4. Falls back to `CacheCompressor.NONE` (no-op) when the library is absent. Non-`byte[]` non-`String` types pass through unchanged.
- **Compression Format** — `Lz4CacheCompressor` stores a 1-byte flag prefix: `0x00` = uncompressed String (UTF-8), `0x01` = LZ4 compressed String with 4-byte little-endian original length header, `0x02` = LZ4 compressed `byte[]`, `0x03` = uncompressed `byte[]`. Compression is transparent: `ExpireManagerImpl.createBuilder()` wraps automatically; `HotKeyCache.unwrapValue()` decompresses on read.
- **Worker** — Standalone Spring Boot application (`zeta-worker`). Consumes App reports via AMQP, runs its own TopK, emits HOT/COOL decisions back to Apps via broadcast. Published as a separate module, never deployed to Maven Central.
- **TopK** — Interface for the hot key detection algorithm. Implemented by `HeavyKeeper` (Count-Min Sketch variant). Tracks the `K` most frequent keys. The app-side facade is **HotKeyDetector** which wraps HeavyKeeper and adds a buffered `add` path for batched frequency updates.
- **ConfidenceEvaluator** — Facade over `BayesianConfidenceEstimator` that decouples the state machine from the specific estimator implementation. Injected into `ZetaStateMachineImpl` to gate every HOT/COOL transition.
- **BayesianConfidenceEstimator** — Normal-Normal conjugate Bayesian model for log-frequency hotness. Computes P(true frequency > threshold) as a closed-form posterior. Prior mean calibrated at ln(10). Likelihood std is dynamically adjusted via the coefficient of variation (CV) of window sums: stable traffic (CV < 0.2) tightens σ down to 0.5×, bursty traffic (CV > 0.5) loosens σ up to 3.0×.
- **ConfidenceLevel** — Three-tier classification of the Bayesian posterior probability: HIGH (≥ 0.95, broadcast immediately), MEDIUM (≥ 0.80, defer to CANDIDATE_HOT), LOW (< 0.80, suppress broadcast). Thresholds defined in `ProbabilityResult`.
- **CANDIDATE_HOT** — State machine holding state for keys that crossed the hot-streak threshold but have only MEDIUM Bayesian confidence. Tracked internally, never broadcast. A single cold window drops back to COLD.
- **Lock Hierarchy** — Three locking domains in strict ordinal order: (1) state machine per-key locks (`Striped.lock`), (2) HeavyKeeper sketch stripe locks (`synchronized(Object[])`), (3) HeavyKeeper admission lock (`ReentrantLock`). The first is highest in acquisition order; the last is lowest. No code path inside a higher-order lock may acquire a lower-order lock.
- **SingleFlight** — Deduplication mechanism that coalesces concurrent loads for the same key into a single execution. Prevents thundering herd.
- **SnowflakeIdGenerator** — Twitter-Snowflake style 64-bit ID generator producing time-sortable, cluster-unique IDs. Bit layout: `1s | 41ts | 2dc | 8worker | 12seq`. Uses `TimeSource` as cached clock. Worker ID derived from `InstanceIdGenerator.getNodeId()`. Attached to all message types (`ReportMessage`, `SyncMessage`, `WorkerMessage`, `WorkerHeartbeatMessage`) as trace ID via AMQP `messageId` header.
- **StandardThreadExecutor** — Tomcat-style `ThreadPoolExecutor` with core→max→queue→reject ordering (vs JDK's core→queue→max→reject). Used for I/O-bound async cache operations. Replaces `ThreadPoolTaskExecutor` in `hotKeyExecutor` bean.
- **Rule** — A cache access rule with a `pattern`, `action` (`BLOCK`/`ALLOW_NO_REPORT`/`ALLOW`), and `type` (`EXACT`/`PREFIX`/`WILDCARD`/`REGEX`). Rules are serialized to JSON for Redis persistence and AMQP broadcast. **JSON should include `"type"`** — the Java field initializer defaults to `RuleType.EXACT`, and `match()` defensively returns `false` if `type` is `null` (e.g. from manual `setType(null)`). Managed by `RuleMatcher`.

## Versions

- **dataVersion** — Monotonically increasing counter (Redis INCR or node-local fallback). Orders data mutations across instances. May be **degraded** (local counter) when Redis is unavailable.
- **decisionVersion** — Monotonically increasing `AtomicLong` on the Worker. Orders HOT/COOL decisions. Never degraded. Independent of dataVersion.
- **rulesVersion** — Monotonically increasing `AtomicLong` in `RuleMatcher`. Orders rule set changes across instances. Used to prevent stale rule broadcasts from overwriting newer rule sets. Independent of both dataVersion and decisionVersion.
- **Degraded Version** — A dataVersion produced when Redis is unavailable. Previously `Long.MIN_VALUE + localCounter` (per-JVM partitioned); now `Long.MIN_VALUE + SnowflakeId` (globally time-sortable, cross-instance comparable). Marked with `isVersionDegraded=true`. Always loses against a normal (Redis) version in broadcast comparisons — the `Long.MIN_VALUE` offset ensures degraded versions sort below any positive Redis INCR value.

## Lifecycle

 - **Graceful Degradation** — When the Worker cluster fails majority quorum (`HealthView.isClusterHealthy()` returns false), the App falls back to local TopK-driven TTL decisions: COOL entries become eligible for local promotion to HOT, and `isWorkerManagedEntry` checks return false. Restored automatically when a Worker heartbeat arrives.
 - **Promote** — Upgrade a cache entry from NORMAL or COOL to HOT with longer TTLs. Triggered by local TopK (in `isPromotableState`) or by Worker broadcast (in `handleHot`).
 - **TTL Jitter** — Configurable ±ratio random offset applied to all TTL expiry timestamps in `ExpireManager` to prevent cache stampedes. Controlled by `zeta.local.ttl-jitter-ratio` (default 0.05 = ±5%). Always enabled.
- **Expire** — Two-tier: **soft expire** (stale-while-revalidate, returns stale data + async refresh) and **hard expire** (absolute TTL, entry invalidated). Soft expire only applies to HOT and COOL entries.
- **Spring Cache** — Standard `@Cacheable`/`@CachePut`/`@CacheEvict` integration via `ZetaCacheManager` (implements `CacheManager`) and `ZetaSpringCache` (implements `Cache`). Enabled via `zeta.spring-cache.enabled`. Companion annotations `@HotKeyCacheTTL`, `@Intercept`, `@Fallback`, and `@NullCaching` work alongside `@Cacheable`.
- **ZetaCacheContext** — ThreadLocal singleton holding TTL (`hardTtlMs`, `softTtlMs`) and `allowNull` context for the current cache operation. `CacheExtensionAspect` snapshots/restores these values around each `@Cacheable` invocation. `ZetaSpringCache.get(Object, Callable)` reads them from context.
- **HotKeyCacheExtensionAspect** — Companion aspect at `@Order(HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE)` that intercepts `@Cacheable` methods, resolves SpEL key, applies `@Intercept`/`@Fallback`/`@HotKeyCacheTTL`/`@NullCaching`, and sets `ZetaCacheContext` before delegating to Spring's `CacheInterceptor`.
- **@NullCaching** — Opt-in annotation for caching `null` return values. When enabled, `null` is stored as internal `NullValue` sentinel inside `CacheEntry`. `ZetaSpringCache` tracks null-cached keys in a `nullCachedKeys` set to distinguish "cached null" from "cache miss".

## Operations

- **L1** — Caffeine cache, App-local. First lookup target.
- **L2** — Optional Redis cache (or any backend via the `Supplier<T>` reader). Async fallback on L1 miss.
- **Report** — Per-key frequency count sent from App to Worker via AMQP. Aggregated locally (Caffeine, 30s, 100k max) before batching.
- **Broadcast** — AMQP exchange `zeta.send.exchange` for cross-instance sync (cache values, HOT/COOL decisions) and Worker-to-App decision delivery.
- **putLocal** — Local-only L1 write without version bump, broadcast, hot-key detection, or reporting. Preserves existing entry metadata. Useful for fallback caching and cache pre-warming.
- **Fluent Read API** — `ZetaReadQuery` returned by `hotKey.read(key)`. Builder
  pattern: `.withPrimary(reader)`, `.thenExecute(fallback)`, `.withTtl(hard, soft)`,
  `.allowBroadcast()`, `.allowNull()`. Terminal: `.execute()` returns `Optional<T>`;
  `.executeOrNull()` returns `T` directly. Eliminates manual fallback chain
  orchestration.
- **Fluent Write API** — `ZetaWriteCommand` returned by `hotKey.write(key)`. Builder pattern: `.withHardTtl()`, `.withSoftTtl()`, `.putThrough(value, writer)`, `.invalidateAfterPut(mutation)`, `.invalidate()`.
- **CacheMode** — Enum: `GET` (standard cache-aside) or `GET_WITH_SOFT_EXPIRE` (stale-while-revalidate). Used by `ZetaReadQuery.withPrimary(reader, mode)`.
- **@Intercept** — AOP annotation for read-side interception. Calls `hotKeyDetector.add()` (keeps TopK accurate) but skips `reporter.record()` (avoids flooding Worker). Does NOT trigger Worker report flow. Applied via `CacheExtensionAspect` on `@Cacheable` methods.
- **@HotKeyCacheTTL** — Per-key TTL override annotation for read operations. Applied via `CacheExtensionAspect` on `@Cacheable` methods.

## Failure Behavior

 - **Worker Majority Dead** — A majority of Worker shards have missed the heartbeat window (5s timeout). Activated threshold: `HealthView.isClusterHealthy()` returns `false`. Local TopK assumes authority: COOL entries become promotable, `isWorkerManagedEntry` returns false. Worker broadcast on recovery overrides local promotions via decisionVersion.
- **Worker Partial Dead** — Some shards alive, some not. Alive shards continue normally. Dead shard's keys are routed to other shards via consistent-hashing ring reconciliation.
- **Redis Degraded** — `nextVersion()` falls back to node-local counter (`Long.MIN_VALUE + counter`). Broadcast carries `isVersionDegraded=true`. Peers apply 4-case comparison to prevent degraded versions overwriting normal ones.
